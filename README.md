# Poject Name
Vendo_api

# Description
This task shouldnâ€™t take more than 4-5 hours to complete. The goal is not to have a fully implemented solution, Work-in-progress is more than enough! We just want to see how would you approach this challenge.

Working with 3rd party systems and APIs would be a big chunk of your work at Vendo


The main objective of this task is to create a simple Ruby SDK for Vendo API.

API documentation is available at: https://developers.getvendo.com/reference/api-getting-started
Access to the docs is password protected: #+u5<)ehSkJV9Z/<


SDK should support
- Authentication
- Create a new Cart
-Fetching a Cart
- Adding an Item to the Cart
- Changing quantity
- Removing item
- Applying a coupon code
